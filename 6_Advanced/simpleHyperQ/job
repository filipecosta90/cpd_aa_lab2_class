#          PBS can send informative email messages to you about the
#          status of your job.  Specify a string which consists of
#          either the single character "n" (no mail), or one or more
#          of the characters "a" (send mail when job is aborted),
#          "b" (send mail when job begins), and "e" (send mail when
#          job terminates).  The default is "a" if not specified.
#          You should also specify the email address to which the
#          message should be send via the -M option.
